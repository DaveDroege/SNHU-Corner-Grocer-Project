# SNHU-Corner-Grocer-Project
This is a school project I was prompted with for my computer science degree. The purpose of the project is to scan through produce sales of a grocery store and output frequencies. The project is set up so that it can take in new data and still produce accurate answers. 

I set up a user friendly menu. I used a set to store the values of the data files inputted, though it takes the extra time to scan through the data upon every request this allows accurate responses if the data is changed.

I could revisit the usage of a set and change this to a map to improve process.

What I struggled with the most was printing the set upon user request. I took time to study on how to do so and with this research I leanred a solid process.

Working with data from external files that could potentailly change helped me learn a lot about the potential of code and its uses.

I did my best to include clear and concise notations in the code. I also used multiple files in order maintain cleanliness.
